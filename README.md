Our Android app allows users to take a picture or select an image of braille from their phone gallery, crop the image, and receive the English conversion. Our AI system uses ratio image segmentation to distinguish different Braille characters. 
For best results, the Braille image is cropped so that the padding around the entire image is about half the size of the distance between each Braille character.
